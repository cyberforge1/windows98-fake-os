## Goals & MVP
The goal was to recreate a familiar Windows 98 environment with functional applications like a calculator, weather app, and a to-do list, using clean and modular JavaScript along with SCSS for styling.


## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- Git
- OpenWeatherMap API

## How To Use
To interact with FakeOS, select an icon on the desktop to open an application. Use the Start menu at the bottom to navigate through available options and features. The applications perform real functions, like fetching live weather data and managing a to-do list.


## Design Goals
- Decisions about project design


## Project Features
- [x] Basic desktop with wallpaper, icons, and modals for apps
- [x] The UI mimics a Windows 98 desktop, with interactive icons and a functional taskbar
- [x] JavaScript modules handle the logic for the calculator, weather data retrieval, and to-do list management.
- [x] A calculator, todo list, and weather application built into the user interface


## Additions & Improvements
- [ ] Addition of Windows 98 modals for a classic look
- [ ] Increased functionality of the start menu
- [ ] Improvements to Desktop Icons
- [ ] Refining the style and function of the apps contained within the project


## Learning Highlights
- This project was an exciting chance to dive deeper into JavaScript. Building the applications like the calculator and the weather tool helped me understand how to structure and execute more complex JavaScript projects. It was particularly fun to tackle real-world problems, like fetching and displaying live data, and seeing my code bring the FakeOS to life was incredibly rewarding.
